# Sadguru's Amrit Tulya - Tea Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

This is UI for Sadguru's Amrit Tulya - Tea Shop website.

In this application, we can add items to the inventory, see details for the added items and delete the items if needed.

As this is only front-end part of the website, you need to connect it with its API for Full stack web application.
